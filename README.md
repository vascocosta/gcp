# Geeks Code Puzzles

Code puzzles created by gluon with the goal of helping anyone learning or training any programming language.

One great way to learn or practice programming skills is by practice, instead of reading guides/tutorials. While such theoretical approaches are good and maybe essential, when you're totally new to a language or programming itself, once you're a bit more experienced, a practical approach is often better. However, many coders (myself included) are lazy and usually struggle to come up with nice many real life problems to solve, eventually stalling. That's where code puzzles shine. Their small and self contained domain makes them relatively easy to both create and solve, therefore keeping developers busy honing their skills, without losing motivation.
